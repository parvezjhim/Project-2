## PET ADOPTION APP 

## Description
I love animals and I always have, (dogs and wolves hold a special place in my heart) and when I was a kid all I ever wanted was a dog. As i grew older I started looking into dogs of my own and was looking at adopting a dog. Most animal service centres are either run by the government or are non-profit organzations which don't leave them with much money for software and technology. My app will make adopting a pet much easier.

# User Stories
A. As a potential adopter, I want to be able to pull up a list of all dogs in my local area and view them 
B. As a potential adopter, I want the ability to see details on certain dogs I click on
C. As a potenitial adopter, I want the ability to add dogs that I am interested in to my favorites list 
D. As a potential adopeter, I want to see comments about the dog from other people who have looked into them
